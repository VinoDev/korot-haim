## Key Features

- Live Preview - See the changes you make

- Mobile support - Responsive Website
  - Runs smoothly on any device, allowing users to create a beatiful resume in hebrew no matter which device they are on.
- Efficiency & Performance
  - By using React elements for our resume preview we manage to save on unnecessary requests to the server, reducing loading time and making real live preview happen!
  - This resuls in a better user experience compared to other resume creation services online.
  - We uploaded the server to Heroku, and client to GitHub pages for better performance and initial loading.
